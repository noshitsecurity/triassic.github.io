I'd start with that stegosaur, the one that is walking. Then checkout the EXIF, let that do the talking.<br /><br />
From there you can dig, but be weary of trolls. Inspect those ones anyways, detectives are gold.<br /><br />
If you are still struggling, git this, you're a goof. Remember the hubub, and privacy *poof*<br /><br />
Use the old walkthrough to grow a new leg. Then kick some triassic the #architect's way.<br /><br />
